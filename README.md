Maze Game with Ai Search strategies With python
First the Maze class:
This Python code defines a `Maze` class responsible for generating a maze using Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method initializes the maze with the specified number of rows and columns. It also calls the `initialize_maze` method to create the initial maze structure with all walls intact.

2. **Initializing Maze Structure**: The `initialize_maze` method creates a dictionary representing the maze structure. Each cell in the maze has information about its four walls (north, south, east, west) being open or closed. Initially, all walls are closed.

3. **Maze Generation using DFS**: The `generate` method generates the maze starting from the specified start cell (typically the top-left corner) using DFS algorithm. It maintains a stack to keep track of the path and a set to keep track of visited cells. It iterates until there are no cells left in the stack. At each step, it selects a random unvisited neighbor of the current cell, removes the wall between the current cell and the selected neighbor, and moves to the selected neighbor. If there are no unvisited neighbors, it backtracks by popping the current cell from the stack.

4. **Removing Walls**: The `remove_wall` method removes the wall between the current cell and the next cell based on the relative positions of the two cells. It updates the maze structure accordingly by setting the appropriate wall to False.

Overall, this code provides a robust implementation of maze generation using the DFS algorithm, resulting in a maze with corridors and walls suitable for exploration in games or other applications.

This Python code is a simple maze game implemented using Pygame library. It generates a random maze using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm and then allows the player to navigate through the maze from the start to the end using either depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. **Imports**: It imports necessary libraries such as Pygame for GUI, random for maze generation, queue for BFS algorithm, and sys for command-line arguments.

2. **Game Class**: This class handles the game initialization, drawing, player movement, and pathfinding.

3. **Initialization**: It initializes Pygame, sets up the display window, and stores game parameters such as difficulty, maze dimensions, and pathfinding algorithm.

4. **Maze Generation**: The maze is generated using a custom `Maze` class, which likely implements a DFS algorithm.

5. **Pathfinding**: It implements a BFS algorithm to find a path from the start to the end of the maze.

6. **Event Handling**: It handles events such as quitting the game (by pressing ESC key or closing the window).

7. **Player Movement**: It moves the player through the maze based on the calculated path.

8. **Drawing**: It draws the maze, walls, player, and updates the display accordingly.

9. **Command-line Arguments**: It parses command-line arguments (--diff, --dim, --path) to set game parameters like difficulty, maze dimensions, and pathfinding algorithm.

10. **Main Execution**: It creates an instance of the Game class using the provided or default parameters and starts the game loop.

Overall, this code provides a basic framework for a maze game where the player can navigate through a randomly generated maze using BFS or DFS algorithms.
